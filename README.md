# 8.-Event-Handling

## 1. Create an html page with a tree of nested directories. 
On click
per list item, it should collapse or expand.
When you hover over an element, the font should become
bold.

## 2. Create an html page with a list of books. 
When you click on the book color
text should change to orange. When you click again on
another book, the previous one must return the previous color.
If the Ctrl key was pressed when the mouse was clicked, then the list item
added/removed from the selected ones. If the mouse was clicked
Shift key is pressed, then all elements are added to the selection
list in the range from the previous clicked to the current one.

the ability to change the size of the block, if you hold the mouse in
bottom right corner and drag it further.
